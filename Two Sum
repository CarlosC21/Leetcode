# PYTHON 
# Given arr of integers, return indices of two numbers so they add up to specific target
# # Cannot use the same element twice

# Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
# Output: [0,1]

# Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
# Output: [1,2]

# enumerate(iterable, start=0) to get a counter in a loop.
# iterable: any object that supports iteration. 

# Time: O(n) Iterating through array once and adding each value to hashmap and checking
# if value exists in hashmap
# Space: using extra memory with hashmap O(n)
